      <description>cope and scope chain, the most important mechanism in JavaScript, are barely clearly explained though specified in ECMA-262 version 5.1. Without scope mechanism, there wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be closure and functional programming. This post is aim to elaborate what happens behind from the very beginning when control enters the global code to execution end.

Firstly, for easy literal, let&amp;rsquo;s agree on the following abbreviation: GE: Global Environment VE: Variable Environment LE: Lexical Environment OLE: Outer Lexcial Environment Reference ER: Environment Record EC: Execution Context go: global object (window for browser, global for NodeJS)</description>

      <description>We always see the word hoisting in some javascript books and technical blogs. Hoisting is grabbed to explain the phenomenon that we can use a variable before we declare it. That&amp;rsquo;s sound incredible in compiling languages, but in javascript it&amp;rsquo;s really there. Some people might think that the interpretor do a magic to restructure the code and put all variable/function declaration statements at the top of the function body. Thinking like that way might help to write or read the program, but that&amp;rsquo;s not the things truely happen behind.</description>

      <title>Function overload in JavaScript</title>

      <description>As we know, Javscript has no function overload in nature. If you try to declare the same function with different signature, the previous one will be overwritten rather than overloaded. As function overload in most OO programming languages are by means of parameters, it operates on different logic according to the passed in parameters. So there is still a way to do function overload in JS.

var foo = { bar: function () { switch (arguments.</description>

      <title>JavaScript prototype and inheritance</title>

      <description>Inheritance in JS is quite different from class based inheritance which is popular for being used in C++ and Java. In class based inheritance language, we have to abstract a class which is not a real world subject. While in prototype based inheritance, we can implement inheritance on objects directly.

The post walks you through how to do inheritance in JS.
Simple object inheritance As every object has an internal property [[prototype]] which points to it&amp;rsquo;s prototype, we can directly assign a super object to it.</description>
