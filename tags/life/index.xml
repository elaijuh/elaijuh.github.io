      <description>Yiin(隐) is an ancient Chinese life style which an individual tends to keep himself away from social life only focusing inside.
I made this product because sometimes I just feel tired of registering and verification, password things when I want to say something. Saying to yourself or even nobody without asking for any comments or feedback should not have any barriers. It&amp;rsquo;s human nature that you are not asking for passport just for talking, you talk when you want to talk.</description>
